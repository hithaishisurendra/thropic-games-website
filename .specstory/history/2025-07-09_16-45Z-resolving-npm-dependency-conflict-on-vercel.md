_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting a dependency conflict error during deployment on Vercel. The error shows:

1. The project has `date-fns@4.1.0` installed
2. `react-day-picker@8.10.1` requires `date-fns@"^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0"` as a peer dependency
3. This creates a conflict because version 4.1.0 doesn't satisfy the peer dependency requirement

The error is an ERESOLVE conflict between date-fns versions. Let me first check the current package.json to see what dependencies are installed, then fix the version conflict.

I should:
1. Check the package.json to see the current dependencies
2. Either downgrade date-fns to version 3.x or upgrade react-day-picker to a version that supports date-fns 4.x
3. Update the package.json accordingly</details></think>

I can see the issue - there's a dependency conflict between `date-fns` and `react-day-picker`. The project has `date-fns@4.1.0` but `react-day-picker@8.10.1` only supports `date-fns` versions 2.x or 3.x.

Let me check the current package.json to see the exact dependencies and fix this:
