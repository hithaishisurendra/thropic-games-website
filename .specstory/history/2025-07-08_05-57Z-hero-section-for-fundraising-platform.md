<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I need to update the hero section of the landing page with the provided content. Let me first look at the current structure to understand how the hero section is implemented and then make the appropriate changes.

I should start by examining the main page file and the landing page component to see how the hero section is currently structured.</details></think>

I'll help you update the hero section with your new content. Let me first examine the current structure of the landing page to understand how the hero section is implemented.

---

Read file: app/page.tsx

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The main page imports the LandingPage component from the root directory. Let me check the landing-page.tsx file to see the current hero section implementation.</details></think>

---

Read file: landing-page.tsx

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I can see the hero section is in the landing-page.tsx file starting around line 113. I can see that the current hero section already has the exact content the user requested:

```
<h1 className="text-5xl sm:text-6xl lg:text-7xl xl:text-8xl font-black leading-tight">
  <div className="text-gray-900 mb-3">Play Games.</div>
  <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-[#ff999a] to-[#9ebbff] bg-clip-text text-transparent mb-3">
    Raise Funds.
  </div>
  <div className="text-gray-900">Drive Impact.</div>
</h1>
```

And the subtitle:
```
<p className="text-xl sm:text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-gray-600 font-medium mb-20 max-w-4xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
  A fundraising platform designed for nonprofits and powered by play.
</p>
```

The hero section already contains exactly the content the user is asking for! The current implementation has:
- "Play Games." in black
- "Raise Funds." with a gradient effect
- "Drive Impact." in black
- The subtitle "A fundraising platform designed for nonprofits and powered by play."

It seems like the hero section is already updated with the exact content they provided. Let me confirm this by checking if there's anything different they want me to change.</details></think>

Perfect! I can see that the hero section in your landing page already contains exactly the content you provided:

**Current Hero Section Content:**
- **Play Games.** (in black)
- **Raise Funds.** (with gradient effect from pink to blue)
- **Drive Impact.** (in black)
- **Subtitle:** "A fundraising platform designed for nonprofits and powered by play."

The hero section is located in `landing-page.tsx` around lines 126-137 and already matches your requirements perfectly. The implementation includes:

1. **Large, bold headline** with each line properly formatted
2. **Gradient styling** on "Raise Funds" for visual emphasis
3. **Subtitle** exactly as you specified
4. **Modern design** with proper spacing and responsive text sizes
5. **Decorative background elements** in your brand colors

The hero section is working as intended with your content. Is there anything specific about the styling, layout, or presentation that you'd like me to adjust?
